# DATK Platform: A Real-Time Trading & Communication System

## 1. Abstract

This repository contains the source code for the DATK Platform, a full-stack application engineered for real-time user interaction. The system integrates a sophisticated cryptocurrency-based bidding game, a comprehensive messaging platform, blockchain event logging, and advanced trading analytics. The architecture is designed around a service-oriented .NET backend and a reactive Angular single-page application (SPA), with a strong emphasis on real-time communication via WebSockets and automated trading strategies.

## 2. System Architecture

The application is built on a decoupled client-server model, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the frontend presentation layer and the backend business logic.

### 2.1. Backend Architecture

The backend is a monolithic ASP.NET Core application structured using a multi-layer, service-oriented architecture.

- **API Layer**: A set of RESTful controllers (`Controllers/`) exposes the primary HTTP endpoints for all CRUD operations and user-driven actions (e.g., placing a bet, sending a message).
- **Service Layer**: The core business logic is encapsulated within services (`Services/`). This layer is responsible for orchestrating data from multiple sources, performing calculations, and handling the primary logic for features like game session management, user authentication, and chat operations.
- **Data Access Layer**: Data persistence is managed via Entity Framework Core, with a `TradeFinanceDbContext` (`Data/`) defining the object-relational mapping to a PostgreSQL database. This context includes all entities, from user models to game and transaction logs.
- **Real-time Subsystem**: SignalR hubs (`Hubs/`) provide the real-time communication backbone. Key hubs include:
    - `GameHub`: Broadcasts game state changes, price updates, and round results to all connected clients.
    - `ChatHub`: Manages real-time messaging, user presence, and typing indicators.
    - `PresenceHub`: Specifically tracks online status for users across the application.
- **Background Services**: The system utilizes `IHostedService` implementations for long-running background tasks, including the `GameSessionManagementService` (to control game rounds), `PMCoinBotService` (to simulate market volatility), and `DailyAnalysisScheduler` (for periodic notifications).

### 2.2. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a modern Angular SPA designed for a dynamic and reactive user experience.

- **Component-Based UI**: The UI is built from a tree of modular Angular components (`features/` and `shared/`), promoting reusability and maintainability.
- **Reactive State Management**: RxJS is used extensively to manage asynchronous data streams from the backend, handle user input, and maintain UI state.
- **Service Layer**: Angular services (`core/services/`) are responsible for encapsulating all communication with the backend. This includes making HTTP requests to the REST API and managing the persistent SignalR connection.
- **Routing**: The application uses a feature-based routing module (`app.routes.ts`) with route guards (`AuthGuard`, `AdminGuard`) to protect application sections based on user authentication and authorization status.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: The frontend leverages the `ethers.js` library to interact directly with user wallets (like MetaMask) for signing transactions or messages, providing a bridge to client-side blockchain operations.

## 3. Core Functionalities In-Depth

### 3.1. Real-Time Bidding Game

The game is a sophisticated, timed, binary-option bidding system with advanced trading features.

1. **Session Management**: 
   - The `GameSessionManagementService` initiates and manages game sessions at configurable intervals

   - Fair play enforcement mechanisms
   - Real-time fraud detection

### 3.2. Messaging Platform

The chat system provides a rich, real-time communication experience.

- **Communication**: All messages are sent and received over the `ChatHub` WebSocket connection.
- **Features**: The platform supports one-on-one and group chats, user presence (online/offline status), read receipts, and typing indicators.
- **Data Persistence**: All messages and chat metadata are stored in the PostgreSQL database, allowing for the retrieval of chat history.

### 3.3. Blockchain Integration

The platform is designed to interface with an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

- **Backend (Nethereum)**: The `SmartContractLogService` uses the Nethereum library to listen for specific events emitted by a designated smart contract. When an event is detected, the service logs the relevant data (transaction hash, addresses, amounts) into the `SmartContractLogs` table in the database.
- **Frontend (Ethers.js)**: The frontend uses `ethers.js` to prompt users for actions via their browser wallet (e.g., MetaMask), enabling client-side interaction with smart contracts.

## 4. Database Schema Overview

The PostgreSQL database schema is defined by EF Core and includes several key tables:

- **User Management**: `Users`, `UserProfiles`, `UserSessions`, `UserBalances`
- **Chat**: `Chats`, `ChatParticipants`, `Messages`, `MessageReads`
- **Game**: `CurrentGameSessions`, `ActiveBets`, `UserGameStats`, `ProfitAnalysis`
- **Transactions & History**: `TransactionHistories`, `BalanceTransactions`, `PMCoinPriceHistories`
- **Blockchain**: `SmartContractLogs`

Relationships are configured to maintain data integrity, such as cascading deletes for bets within a game session.

## 5. Security Model

- **Authentication**: The primary authentication strategy is session-based, managed by the custom `SessionAuthenticationMiddleware`. JWT support is also implemented but can be toggled.
- **Authorization**: Access to specific API endpoints and frontend routes is restricted using role-based access control (RBAC). The backend defines policies like `AdminOnly`, and the frontend uses `AdminGuard` to enforce this on the client-side.
- **Transport Security**: The application is configured to use HTTPS in production. A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is enforced via middleware to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **CORS**: A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is configured to only allow requests from the known Angular frontend origin (`http://localhost:4200`).
