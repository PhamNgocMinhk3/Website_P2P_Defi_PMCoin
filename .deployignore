# .deployignore
# Patterns to exclude from deployments and CI packages.
# - This file is a developer-managed list of sensitive files and build artifacts.
# - It is NOT automatically used by git. Integrate it into your CI/CD or deployment scripts,
#   e.g., rsync --exclude-from=.deployignore or your archive step.

# --- Backend configs ---
**/appsettings*.json
**/secrets*.json

# --- Frontend environment files (may contain API keys / RPC endpoints) ---
client-angular/src/environments/*

# --- ABI and smart contract artifacts ---
**/*.abi
**/*abi*.json
**/*-abi*.json
**/*ABI*.json
client-angular/src/assets/abis/**

# --- Keys, secrets, keystores ---
**/.env*
**/*privateKey*
**/*private*.*
**/*key*.*
**/*secret*.*
**/*HashSecret*
**/*TmnCode*
**/*credentials*
**/*.keystore
**/*.p12
**/*.pem
**/*.key
**/*.jks

# --- Build outputs / bundles (avoid shipping large built bundles with embedded strings) ---
client-angular/dist/**
**/bin/**
**/obj/**

# --- Optional: local-only files, editors, OS ---
.vscode/**
*.log
*.tmp

# Review this file before deploying. If a pattern excludes something required in production,
# provide sanitized configurations via environment variables or a secret store.
